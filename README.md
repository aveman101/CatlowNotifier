CatlowNotifier
==============

Gets the currently showing movie from thecatlow.com, and mails a notification of the movie to recipients

This tool is designed to be run on a recurring schedule (once/day typically), and it will check to see if the movie has changed on the website.

Note: This project hasn't been updated in quite some time. The script may no longer work due to changes in webpage at thecatlow.com.
